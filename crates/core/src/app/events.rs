//! The `Event` enum — every input the headless [`App`](super::App) accepts.
//!
//! Kept unified (one enum, not split per domain): `apply(Event) -> Vec<Effect>`
//! is the crate's public contract and its testing model, so the variants live
//! together even though their handlers now fan out across the `app/` submodules.
