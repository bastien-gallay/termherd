//! Filterable workspace snapshot — the structured "DOM" an MCP client (or the
//! G1 dev loop) reads to perceive termherd before acting on it.
//!
//! The design constraint is context size: a driving agent must never pay for
//! state it did not ask for. So a snapshot is **light by default and filterable
//! at call** ([`SnapshotFilter`]) — the bare read is structure only (config,
//! sidebar, tabs), and terminal text is opt-in and scoped. Deep per-session
//! reads live in a later `read_terminal` rung; this is the overview, the map
//! you zoom from.
//!
//! Two parts of the picture are **adapter-injected** ([`SnapshotInputs`]): the
//! resolved config (settings live in the `app` adapter) and per-session terminal
//! text (the grid lives in the `pty` adapter). Everything else — the sidebar,
//! the tabs, the focus — the pure core reads from `App` itself. **Pure**: no
//! I/O, no clock, no panic.
