//! The iced shell — intentionally thin (ARCHITECTURE §8): translate GUI
//! messages into `core` events, perform the returned `core` effects against
//! the adapters, and render `core` state.
//!
//! This module is the state-transition half — the `Shell` struct, the
//! `Message` enum, `update`/`subscription` and the command methods. The rest
//! is split by concern into submodules:
//!
//! - [`view`] — how state is rendered (sidebar, main pane, tabs).
//! - [`terminal`] — the embedded terminal `canvas::Program` + link opener.
//! - [`ime`] — the input-method wrapper that composes dead/accent keys.
//! - [`input`] — keyboard translation (chords / `TermKey` / modifiers).
//! - [`streams`] — the PTY-output and fs-watch subscription sources.
