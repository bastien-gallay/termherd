//! The async transport substrate: a timeout-bounded request/reply bridge from
//! an off-thread transport task into the iced-owned `core::App`.
//!
//! `core::App` is pure and single-threaded — the iced shell owns it and applies
//! events on the UI thread; there is no shared `&mut App`. So an external
//! transport (a future socket/HTTP listener, wired later) cannot call it
//! directly. Instead it hands a [`Request`] plus a private reply channel across
//! a bounded channel; the shell drains it in `update`, reads state, and answers
//! on the reply channel. Every call is wrapped in `tokio::time::timeout`, so a
//! shell that never answers (the `openDiff`-style hang) fails the *caller* fast
//! rather than blocking it forever.
//!
//! Only the caller side needs the tokio runtime (for the time driver behind
//! `timeout`); the receiver side is driven by iced's own executor, so the two
//! runtimes meet only at the runtime-agnostic channels.
