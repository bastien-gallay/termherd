//! The orchestration seam: carrying an MCP [`Action`] out against the running

//! apply the existing event(s) → report the resulting focus" flow lives in one
//! place, mirroring how [`launch`](super::launch) owns the spawn-and-focus flow.
//!
//! Every action is a thin wrapper over an existing core
//! [`Event`](termherd_core::Event): the shell owns `core::App` *and* the one
//! effect executor, so it can resolve the stable handle, apply the event, and
//! perform the effects — the read-only `respond` cannot, since it holds only a
