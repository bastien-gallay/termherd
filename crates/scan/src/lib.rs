//! termherd-scan — filesystem discovery adapter (`F-session-browser`, M1).
//!
//! Walks `~/.claude/projects`, derives each folder's real project path and
//! digests every session JSONL, using the pure `termherd-claude` codec.
//! Implements [`termherd_core::ports::ProjectScanner`].
//!
//! The walking order is a faithful port of upstream's
//! `deriveProjectPath` + `session-cache.readFolderFromFilesystem`
//! (`doctly/switchboard`): the project path comes from the first `cwd`
//! found in direct `*.jsonl` files, then in session subdirectories and
//! their `subagents/`; listed sessions are the *direct* `*.jsonl` files
//! only. A folder whose path cannot be derived is dropped, like upstream —
//! but logged, not silent (Q5).
//!
//! The concerns live in submodules under the crate root: `watch` (the
//! debounced fs watch behind FR2, an independent leaf), `cache` (the
//! incremental-scan signatures and reuse), `derive` (cwd derivation, the
//! codec seam), `walk` (the two-pass walk into records), and `repo` (the
//! repo-root helper). Dependency direction: `lib → walk → derive → cache`,
//! with `watch`/`repo` independent.
//!
//! Rescans are incremental: the walk (`read_dir` + one stat per file)
//! always runs in full — it is what detects adds and removes — but a session
//! file is only re-read and re-digested when its mtime or size changed since
//! the previous scan. A live Claude session appending to one transcript costs
//! one file read per rescan, not one per session.
//!
//! [`FsScanner::claude_default`] re-implements the `USERPROFILE`/`HOME`
//! precedence that `app::paths::home_dir` centralises. That duplication is
//! inherent to the hexagonal split — `scan` must not depend on `app` — so it
//! stays, deliberately, rather than being deduplicated across the wall.
