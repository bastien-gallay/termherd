# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and the project uses [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed (list_sessions over MCP)

- `list_sessions` answered a bare JSON array, which MCP clients reject on their
  schema check — every call failed before the caller saw a row. The sessions now
  ride in a `sessions` field, like every other tool's answer (#299).
- Every tool now shapes its structured answer at one seam, which refuses
  anything but an object, and a sweep reads the tool list from the router so a
  tool added later cannot slip past the rule.

### Added (a repository in the sidebar, before it has any session)

- A sidebar row is no longer born only from a session. **+ Add a repo** opens
  the native folder picker, and dropping a folder on the window does the same
  thing — a dropped *file* is ignored (#279). The row carries the usual `$` and
  🤖 launch buttons, says `No sessions yet` until it has one, and sorts to the
  top until then. A ✕ takes it back out; it appears only on rows you added,
  since a discovered project has no declaration to drop.
- Hand-added repositories live in `~/.termherd/metadata.json`, beside stars and
  renames. Nothing is written under `~/.claude`.
- Over MCP: `add_repo` and `forget_repo`, answering about the sidebar row —
  membership, not what the window happens to be drawing — and `declared` on
  each project in `snapshot` and in the ⌘⇧S capture.

### Changed (clipboard mouse gestures)

- The two classic terminal clipboard conventions are settings now, both off by
  default: `terminal.copy_on_select` and `terminal.paste_on_right_click` (#36).
  **Copy-on-select changes behaviour.** It was already there and
  unconditional — a drag release and a double-click both copied — so what this
  adds is the *off* position, and off is the default. Set
  `"terminal": { "copy_on_select": true }` to keep what you had. A value that
  is neither `true` nor `false` leaves its own gesture off with a warning
  rather than failing the whole file, like a malformed colour.
- The right-click paste is addressed to the pane **under the pointer**, not the
  focused one, and focuses it; a confirmation prompt refuses it exactly as it
  refuses the paste chord.

### Fixed (copy chord)

- The copy chord reads the terminal's live on-screen selection, and prefers it
  to the cache of the last copied text (#36). The cache was previously the only
  thing it read, and only an automatic copy filled it — so with copy-on-select
  off, a mouse selection could not be copied by any means. Preferring the live
  highlight also fixes the older half of the bug: with a stale cache and a
  fresh selection, the chord used to copy what had been copied before.

### Fixed (nested launches)

- A shell opened by a termherd that was itself launched from a termherd shell
  now starts (#244). The shell integration hands zsh a private `ZDOTDIR`, so
  everything descending from that shell — including another termherd — inherited
  it and read it as the user's own home. Session ids restart at 1 with each run,
  so the inherited directory was usually the *same* one the new session was
  about to write: its generated `.zshenv` sourced itself and the shell died on
  `job table full or recursion limit exceeded` without reaching a prompt,
  leaving its session on `starting`. Where the ids differed it started, but
  replayed another session's hooks and never reached the user's own `.zshrc`.
  A directory termherd generated is no longer replayed from — recognised by its
  name, since a nested instance can run under a different `TMPDIR` — and the zsh
  recipe now exports `TERMHERD_ORIG_ZDOTDIR` beside the private one, so a
  `ZDOTDIR` the user set themselves survives any depth of nesting rather than
  degrading to `$HOME`.

### Fixed (session status)

- Sessions no longer sit on `starting` forever, which made `wait_for_status`
  settle only by expiring and left the close confirmation unarmed for a shell
  (#236). Two independent holes, both reproduced outside termherd on a raw PTY,
  so neither was an artefact of a debug build:
  - **A plain shell had no status source at all.** The fold only understood
    Claude's dialect (glyph titles, OSC 9), and a shell emits none of it. Every
    session now runs with an OSC 133 shell-integration snippet — zsh via a
    private `ZDOTDIR`, bash via `--rcfile`, fish via `--init-command`, each
    replaying the user's own startup files first — and its prompt/command marks
    fold into the same `SessionStatus`. Where the injection cannot apply (an
    unknown shell, an unwritable temp directory) the PTY's foreground process
    group stands in, retired for good by the first mark or Claude signal so it
    can never contradict what the terminal says about itself. The bash and fish
    recipes need a command-line argument, which is never added to the platform's
    *default* program — it would demote the login shell to an ordinary one and
    change which startup files run — so those two are integrated only when the
    shell is named in the settings; zsh needs no argument and always is. ConPTY
    exposes no foreground group, so that fallback is silent on Windows.
  - **The Claude channel was switchable off by the user.** With
    `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE` set in `~/.claude/settings.json` the
    CLI emits no OSC title at all — and that `env` block outranks the
    environment termherd spawns with, so exporting the variable back had no
    effect. A Claude launch now passes a private `--settings` overlay, which
    outranks it in turn and merges with (never replaces) the user's settings.
    `--settings` arrived in Claude Code 1.0.61, which the README now states as
    the CLI floor for launching Claude sessions — an older one rejects the flag
    and the launch fails rather than merely losing its status.
- The CLI's own product name (`✳ Claude Code`), which it reports as its title
  until it has something session-specific to say, no longer renames the hosting
  tab — a tab would have traded its project name for the program's.
- A session's private temp files — its shell-integration directory, its mcp
  config with the live bridge's **bearer token**, its settings overlay — are now
  deleted when the session is torn down instead of accumulating for good.

### Added (tab reorder)

- Open session tabs can be reordered by drag-and-drop (#25, FR5). Press a tab
  and drag it onto another slot; the carried tab fades and the drop slot is
  outlined, and the reorder commits on release (a plain click still just
  activates the tab). The order lives solely in `core::Workspace::move_tab` (a
  pure mutator that keeps the active tab pointed at the same tab); the iced tab
  strip holds only transient pointer state, so there is no rival tab tree.

### Fixed (scroll proptest)

- Relaxed the `emitted_lines_never_drift_more_than_one_line` scroll proptest
  (#98): it reconstructed the cumulative input in `f32`, so rounding noise over
  a long delta stream could nudge the drift just past one line (~1e-6) and fail
  a sound accumulator. It now sums in `f64` with a small epsilon; the found
  counterexample is kept as a regression seed.

### Added (search snippet)

- Search results now show *what* matched (#58). A content hit (in a session's
  first prompt, indexed transcript text, or slug) renders the matched line in
  muted text under the session row, windowed around the hit and clipped to the
  sidebar; title-only hits stay single-line. The location is computed by a pure
  `core::browser::content_snippet` returning the line plus the match's byte
  range, unit-tested for content/title/slug hits and long-line truncation.

### Fixed (tab status)

- Tab activity dots (and the focused-terminal badge) stayed frozen on the
  status a session had when it opened (#18). Claude CLI only emits its
  busy/idle/attention OSC status stream when it detects iTerm2 as the host, so
  the PTY adapter now advertises `TERM_PROGRAM=iTerm.app` (with a version) on
  every spawned session. The headless status plumbing was already correct; it
  simply never received any signals to react to.

### Added (terminal links)

- Terminal links are now clickable (#28). URLs in terminal output
  (`http`/`https`/`file`/`ftp`) are detected per row; holding Ctrl/Cmd
  underlines the link under the pointer and shows a hand cursor, and
  Ctrl/Cmd+click opens it in the OS default handler. Detection is a pure
  `core::links` scan (trailing punctuation and unbalanced brackets trimmed);
  the open is a new `Effect::OpenUrl` performed by the shell.

## [0.1.0-prerelease.4] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed (app launch)

- The packaged app (`.app`/`.dmg`, and the bare binary when started from a
  read-only directory) launched nothing with no error message. The
  single-instance lock file was created relative to the working directory,
  which is `/` when launched from Finder — unwritable, so startup aborted. The
  lock now lives at an absolute path under the temp dir, and a lock-creation
  failure no longer prevents the app from starting.

## [0.1.0-prerelease.3] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- `F-packaging-ci` (Windows + Intel macOS): the desktop-installer workflow now
  ships **NSIS only** on Windows — WiX/MSI rejects a non-numeric version, so the
  `-prerelease.N` suffix broke MSI packaging and failed the whole Windows job
  (the NSIS `*-setup.exe` itself built fine). Intel macOS (`x86_64-apple-darwin`)
  is now cross-compiled on an Apple-Silicon runner instead of the scarce
  `macos-13` Intel runners, which were queueing for hours.

## [0.1.0-prerelease.2] - 2026-06-17

### Added

- `F-packaging-ci` (desktop installers): GUI installer bundles to complement
  the existing cargo-dist bare-binary pipeline. A `cargo-packager` config
  (`[package.metadata.packager]` in `crates/app/Cargo.toml`) plus a generated
  app icon set (`crates/app/icons/`, all derived from `icon.svg` via
  `generate.sh`) and a new `.github/workflows/package.yml` build macOS
  `.app`/`.dmg`, Windows `.msi`/`.exe` (NSIS) and Linux `.deb`/`.AppImage` on a
  per-target matrix and attach them to the GitHub Release that `release.yml`
  creates (poll-then-upload, so the two workflows never race to create the
  release). The macOS `.app` and `.dmg` paths are verified locally; bundles are
  unsigned for now (signing/notarization pending certificates, OQ5). The README
  gains an **Install** section.
- `F-plans-memory` (M3, read-only first slice): browse and view Claude's plans
  (`~/.claude/plans/*.md`) and memory files — the global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
  and each project's `CLAUDE.md` — from a "Plans & mémoire" section in the
  sidebar. Clicking one loads it off-thread and shows it read-only in the main
  pane (✕ returns to the terminal); the doc list refreshes on each scan so
  project memories appear once their paths are known. A new `docs` file adapter
  lists and reads. Editing — and the `~/.claude` write-scope change it needs —
  is a deliberate follow-up.
- `F-session-metadata` (M3): a star / archive / custom-title overlay on the
  read-only Claude sessions, persisted to `~/.termherd/metadata.json` (we never
  write under `~/.claude`). The browser pins starred sessions to the top of
  their group, hides archived ones behind an "Afficher les archivées" toggle,
  and shows custom titles. Star (★/☆) and archive (⊟/⊞) are per-row sidebar
  buttons. The overlay is pure in `core` — `SessionMeta`, applied in
  `visible_projects`, behind `ToggleStar` / `ToggleArchive` / `RenameSession` /
  `ShowArchivedToggled` events that emit a `SaveMetadata` effect (default
  entries are pruned, so a toggle-back leaves no noise). Renaming is inline: a
  ✎ button swaps the title for an edit field that commits on Enter (or ✓);
  while it is open the field owns the keyboard, so terminal routing pauses.
- `F-keyboard-shortcuts` (M3): a configurable keymap (FR9). Every shortcut is
  now a `KeyChord -> Action` binding in `core::keymap` (pure, testable):
  human chords (`"ctrl+shift+c"`, order/case-insensitive) parse to a chord,
  platform-aware defaults bind copy/paste/close/search (⌘ on macOS, Ctrl
  elsewhere) plus `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` tab cycling, and the `keys`
  section of `settings.json` overrides any action (one chord or a list).
  Unknown actions and unparsable chords are logged and skipped. The shell
  builds a chord from each key event and runs the bound action, so the
  hard-coded clipboard chords are gone and keyboard tab switching, tab close
  and search focus now work; `split-*` / `focus-next/prev` actions are bound
  as those features land.
- `F-settings` (M3, thin): user settings (FR10) persisted to
  `~/.termherd/settings.json`. A **shell profile** (program + args) is injected
  into the `PtyManager` so each session launches the chosen shell instead of
  the platform default; a **GUI theme** (dark/light) dresses the iced chrome
  (sidebar, tab strip, buttons) while the terminal grid keeps its own colours.
  Every field defaults, so a missing or corrupt file still starts cleanly.
  Window bounds keep their own `window.json` (FR12); an in-app settings panel
  is the full version later, so for now the file is edited by hand.
- `F-builtin-terminal` (M2): clipboard copy/paste shortcuts (FR4). `Ctrl+V` /
  `Ctrl+Shift+V` paste the clipboard into the focused PTY (previously only
  copy-on-select existed, so there was no way to paste at all); the chord
  shadows the raw `^V` control byte, the Windows-terminal convention.
  `Ctrl+Shift+C` copies the current selection — plain `Ctrl+C` stays the
  interrupt signal, as in every terminal. On macOS the Cmd key drives copy
  (`Cmd+C`) and paste (`Cmd+V`) directly, leaving Ctrl free for the interrupt.
  Multi-line paste is handled
  correctly: newlines normalise to carriage returns, and when the application
  has enabled bracketed paste (DECSET 2004, which the `pty` `Screen` now
  reports) the text is wrapped in `ESC[200~`…`ESC[201~` so it lands as one
  block instead of submitting line by line.
- `F-session-tabs` (M3): open sessions are now navigable tabs, not just the
  last-launched terminal. A tab strip above the terminal switches between
  sessions; each chip carries its activity dot (the FR8 tab badge, folded to
  the most urgent status of the sessions it hosts) and a close button. Closing
  a tab kills its session's PTY — the first UI-driven `Effect::Kill` — and
  drops the session from the live registry and its cached screen. The tab tree
  edits are pure in `core` (`Workspace::activate`/`close_tab`, `Tab::sessions`,
  `App::tab_status`) behind `Event::ActivateTab`/`CloseTab`, exhaustively unit
  tested; the shell only renders the strip and forwards clicks. Drag-reorder
  (FR5) and keyboard tab-switching (`F-keyboard-shortcuts`) are not yet wired.
- `F-builtin-terminal` (M2): the embedded terminal is now a real terminal.
  The `pty` reader builds a `Screen` snapshot — the visible grid with per-cell
  RGB (resolved from the xterm-256 palette), the cursor and a scrolled flag —
  from `alacritty_terminal`'s renderable content. The shell draws it on an
  iced `canvas` (colour cells + cursor), routes raw keyboard to the focused
  PTY (control combos, named keys, cursor sequences, layout text; gated by a
  terminal/search focus model so the search box keeps its own typing),
  propagates window resize to the PTY's cell geometry, and resumes a Claude
  session with `claude --resume <id>` when a session row is clicked. Verified
  end-to-end on Windows: clicking a session resumed a live Claude run inside
  TermHerd, its OSC activity drove the badge, and keystrokes reached it.
- `F-builtin-terminal` (M2, completed): wheel scrollback and drag-to-select
  with copy-to-clipboard close out FR4. The `pty` adapter now runs a reader
  thread (blocking PTY reads) feeding a terminal thread that owns the grid
  and applies bytes / resize / scroll commands, so the viewport reacts to the
  wheel immediately instead of waiting on the next PTY output. Selection is
  tracked in the canvas, highlighted, and copied on release.
- `F-status-notifications` (M2, completed for the current surfaces): the
  `pty` reader thread decodes each raw chunk with `termherd_claude::osc`
  *before* the bytes reach `alacritty_terminal` (which would consume the
  sequences) and folds the markers into a per-session status, emitting
  `PtyEvent::Status` on change. Beyond busy/idle, an OSC 9 notification — a
  permission prompt or an explicit "needs your attention" ping — now maps to
  a distinct `Attention` status; it is sticky against a bare idle prompt (the
  user still has to act) and cleared only when work resumes. The shell feeds
  it to `core` (`Event::StatusChanged`) and surfaces it as a coloured badge on
  the focused terminal *and* as a per-session dot in the sidebar (`core` now
  records which Claude session each terminal resumed, so a browsed row shows
  its live activity). Tab badges arrive with tabs (M3); the bell is decoded
  but deliberately not treated as an activity status.
- `F-builtin-terminal` (M2, in progress): `termherd-pty` adapter — one
  `portable-pty` PTY + `alacritty_terminal` grid per session, owned by its
  own reader thread (actor-per-session, the structural fix for the
  `realSessionId` race, Q6). A `PtyResponder` replies to cursor-position
  queries (`ESC[6n`), without which ConPTY never starts the child on
  Windows. The headless core gained the terminal lifecycle —
  `Event::LaunchSession`/`TerminalInput`/`TerminalResized`/`PtyExited` and
  `Effect::Spawn`/`Write`/`Resize`/`Kill` over a monotonic `SessionId`
  registry — and the iced shell performs those effects against the
  `PtyHost` port: clicking a project opens a terminal, its live screen
  renders as monospace text with a line-input box. Verified end-to-end on
  Windows ConPTY (spawn → reply → write → grid → kill) and visually in the
  shell. Pending: raw key input, colours/cursor/selection, scrollback,
  widget-driven resize.
- Initial scaffold: Cargo workspace (`core` / `claude` / `app`), pinned
  toolchain (1.95.0), MIT license, README, deny config.
- CI: `fmt`, `clippy -D warnings`, `cargo test`, `cargo-deny`, markdownlint
  required on PR (Q2).
- `F-foundations` (M0): workspace skeleton, dependency rule, `tracing` init,
  single-instance lock in `termherd-app`.
- `F-app-shell` (M0): iced 0.14 window shell (OQ1 settled on iced) —
  placeholder view, window bounds persisted to `~/.termherd/window.json`
  on close and restored on launch (FR12); close requests intercepted so
  bounds always save. The menu is deferred to M3: iced has no native menu
  API, and the menu will mirror keymap actions (`F-keyboard-shortcuts`),
  so they land together.
- `F-search` (M1): in-memory search (FR3) — case-insensitive over titles,
  summaries, slugs and indexed text, titles-only toggle; pure
  `filter_projects` in `core` behind `Event::SearchChanged`, search box +
  checkbox in the sidebar.
- `F-session-browser` (M1, completed): debounced `notify` watch on
  `~/.claude/projects` (FR2) — bursts of fs events coalesce into one
  rescan; the sidebar live-updates while Claude CLI writes. Verified
  live: create/delete in the projects tree triggers a ~200 ms rescan.
- `F-session-browser` (M1, first slice): `termherd-scan` adapter — walks
  `~/.claude/projects` with upstream's exact derivation order (direct
  JSONL, then session subdirs and `subagents/`), worktree collapse with
  the fs existence check, underivable folders dropped like upstream but
  logged; `core::browser` — pure grouping (one group per real path, FR1;
  recency ordering) behind `Event::ScanCompleted`; the shell scans off
  the UI thread at startup (FR2, initial scan only) and renders the
  sidebar. Live `notify` updates and FTS search still to come in M1.
- `F-packaging-ci` (M0, unsigned): cargo-dist 0.32 release pipeline —
  tag-triggered GitHub workflow building mac (ARM + x64), Linux
  (x64 + ARM) and Windows artifacts with shell/PowerShell installers and
  checksums. Windows artifact verified locally (10.6 MB binary vs the
  Electron app's ~150 MB). Signing/notarization pending certificates
  (OQ5).
- First TDD targets:
  - `termherd-core::workspace` — pane tree + tabs with unit tests
    (open / split / focus).
  - `termherd-claude::path` — `encode_project_path`, byte-faithful port of
    the JS reference, with unit tests.
  - `termherd-claude::derive` — real-project-path recovery (`extract_cwd`
    from JSONL, worktree collapse), ported from `derive-project-path.js`;
    unit + property tests.
  - `termherd-claude::digest` — session digest (summary, title precedence
    per the #46 contract, message counts, FTS text), ported from
    `read-session-file.js`; deliberately skips corrupt lines instead of
    dropping the whole session (Q5); unit + property tests.
  - `termherd-claude::osc` — PTY status decoding (busy spinner / ✳ idle /
    OSC 9 notifications / alt-screen / bell), ported from the inline
    `main.js` parsing; unit + property tests.
  - Codec validated against a real `~/.claude/projects` tree: every derived
    `cwd` re-encodes to its folder name; all sessions digested.
- `docs/background/` — imported the four 2026-05-27 analysis docs that
  produced the restart decision (assessment, feature sizing, the Electron
  app's architecture and NFRs) plus an index README.
