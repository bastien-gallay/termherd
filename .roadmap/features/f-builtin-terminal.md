A native PTY terminal per session, rendered on an iced canvas.

PTY + native terminal widget (M2): `termherd-pty` adapter (`portable-pty` +
`alacritty_terminal`, reader + terminal thread per session, cursor-report reply
for ConPTY); iced `canvas` renders the colour grid + cursor; raw keyboard
routed to the focused PTY; wheel scrollback; drag-to-select + copy; `claude
--resume` on a session click; PTY resize follows the window. Verified
end-to-end on Windows resuming a real Claude session. The widget shipped; the
**terminal ergonomics a user compares against Ghostty/iTerm are still open**,
each a refinement of this entry rather than a feature of its own:
Cmd/Ctrl-clickable
hyperlinks whose displayed text differs from the URL (OSC 8, #84), auto-scroll
when a drag-selection reaches the canvas edge (#157), and Alt+drag rectangular
selection (#159). The **clipboard mouse conventions** closed on that list
(#36): `terminal.copy_on_select` and `terminal.paste_on_right_click`, both off
by default. Copy-on-select was in fact already shipped and unconditional, so
the setting *added the off position* — the automatic copy is now opt-in and the
copy chord is the default path. The paste is addressed to the pane under the
pointer rather than the focused one, which is why it needed a session-carrying
message rather than a second call into the existing paste; both paths now meet
at one `paste_into` seam that decides bracketing once. Gating the automatic
copy also disabled the copy *chord*, which read only a cache the automatic copy
filled — so the chord now reads the terminal's live selection and prefers it,
which fixes the older bug of a stale cache outranking a fresh highlight too.
**Two earlier records read as contradictions and are not**: the M2 line above
says "drag-to-select + copy", and `CHANGELOG.md` says "copied on release" under
a released `0.1.0-prerelease` heading. Both are accurate as dated records of
what shipped then; the default changed afterwards, and the `[Unreleased]`
section carries the correction. Cmd/Ctrl-clickable
**file paths** shipped on that same seam
(#252): `core::paths` finds a candidate syntactically, and a `PathResolver`
port checks it against the filesystem — the check, not the regex, is what keeps
prose like `and/or` from lighting up half the screen. Resolution tries the live
`cwd` from [F-terminal-cwd](#f-terminal-cwd), then the repository holding it,
then the launch directory, because `cargo`, `git` and `pytest` each print
relative to a different root. It opened through the OS handler, which left two
debts that closed together in #257 — an `open.command` in `settings.json`, with
`{path}` / `{line}` / `{col}` templates. Configured, it replaces the handoff:
the `:line` the terminal printed is finally honoured, and since an explicit
command consults no file association, the refusal that kept a path which *is* a
program from being opened has nothing left to protect and is lifted with it.
That refusal was airtight on macOS/Linux and mostly nominal on Windows, where
the association table maps every installed interpreter — so the command does not
narrow that gap, it removes it. The command is argv and never a shell line: the
configured string is split on whitespace *before* `{path}` is substituted, so a
filename cannot become a second argument, and a placeholder in the program name
is refused outright — what the terminal printed picks the file, never the
executable. Unconfigured, the OS handoff and its refusal both stand.
Two contract bugs sit on the same surface: mouse buttons are never
encoded to the child, so no mouse-mode app gets a click (#155), and the
`emitted_lines_never_drift` property has a known failing scroll sequence whose
seed was never committed (#102)
