# TermHerd

> A Rust replatform experiment for a Claude Code session
> workspace. Native, terminal-multiplexer-style (tabs + splits + keyboard
> driven), with the quality bar the predecessor lacked.

Inspired by [doctly/switchboard](https://github.com/doctly/switchboard), the
Electron app it replatforms; see [`docs/background/`](docs/background/) for
the full reasoning archive.

## Documentation

**📖 [termherd.github.io/termherd](https://termherd.github.io/termherd/)** —
the user manual: philosophy, install, quick start, the workspace surfaces
(sidebar, tabs and splits, terminal, status, capture), the MCP control surface,
the shortcut reference and the `settings.json` reference.

It is an [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) whose sources live in
[`docs/src/`](docs/src/); `just docs` builds it, `just docs-serve` previews it
with live reload, and every push to `main` republishes it. A user-visible
change updates it in the same PR — see [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md).

This is an early scaffold. Status, scope, and design live in:

- [`docs/PRD.md`](docs/PRD.md) — Product Requirements Document
- [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) — Architecture
- [`ROADMAP.md`](ROADMAP.md) — feature buckets (MoSCoW); generated from
  `.roadmap/` by [roadmark](https://github.com/bastien-gallay/roadmark)
- [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md)

## Install

### Requirements

A shell, and — to launch Claude sessions — the **Claude Code CLI, 1.0.61 or
newer**, on your `PATH`.

That floor is the `--settings` flag, which arrived in 1.0.61 and which termherd
puts on every Claude launch. It re-enables the CLI's terminal title for that
session only, and the title is where a Claude session's activity comes from —
without it, a `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_TERMINAL_TITLE` anywhere in your own settings
would leave every session reading `starting` forever. An older CLI would reject
the flag and fail to start; termherd's other flag, `--mcp-config` (the live
bridge), has been available since 0.2.75.

A plain shell needs nothing: its activity comes from an OSC 133
shell-integration snippet termherd injects itself (zsh, bash, fish), falling
back on the PTY's foreground process group otherwise. Two cases take that
fallback. Bash and fish need the snippet passed as a command-line argument,
which termherd will not add to the platform's *default* program — it would
demote your login shell to an ordinary one and change which startup files run —
so they get the finer marks only when you name your shell in the settings; zsh
needs no argument and is always integrated. And on Windows ConPTY exposes no
foreground process group, so a shell with neither route stays on `starting`.

Each tagged release publishes desktop installers on the
[Releases](https://github.com/Termherd/termherd/releases) page. Pick the
one for your platform:

- **macOS** — download `TermHerd_<version>_<arch>.dmg`, open it, and drag
  **TermHerd** into Applications. The build is not yet notarized (signing is
  pending, see the roadmap), so on first launch right-click the app and choose
  **Open**, or clear the quarantine flag:
  `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/TermHerd.app`.
- **Windows** — run the `*-setup.exe` (NSIS installer). Because it is unsigned
  for now, SmartScreen may warn — choose **More info → Run anyway**.
- **Linux** — install the `.deb`
  (`sudo apt install ./termherd_<version>_amd64.deb`), or download the
  `.AppImage`, `chmod +x` it, and run it directly.

Prefer a bare command-line binary? The same releases carry one-line installers
that drop `termherd` into your Cargo bin directory:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -LsSf \
  https://github.com/Termherd/termherd/releases/latest/download/termherd-installer.sh | sh
```

```powershell
# Windows
powershell -c "irm https://github.com/Termherd/termherd/releases/latest/download/termherd-installer.ps1 | iex"
```

### Verify a Linux download

Linux release binaries carry a sigstore *keyless* build-provenance attestation
(no signing key — the signer is the release workflow, via GitHub OIDC, logged
in the public Rekor transparency log). Verify a download with the `gh` CLI:

```bash
gh attestation verify termherd-x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu.tar.xz \
  --repo Termherd/termherd
```

A successful check proves both integrity and that the artifact was built by
this repository's CI. A `SHA256SUMS` file is also attached to each release.

## Run from source

```bash
cargo run -p termherd-app
```

## Configuration

Optional user settings live in `~/.termherd/settings.json` (on Windows,
`%USERPROFILE%\.termherd\settings.json`). The file is read at startup; if it
is missing or invalid, TermHerd falls back to defaults rather than refusing
to start — out-of-range values clamp, and a single bad value (a typo'd
colour, an unknown key action) degrades alone with a logged warning instead
of resetting the rest of the file. There is no in-app settings panel yet —
edit the file and restart.

The annotated reference template is
[`docs/settings.example.jsonc`](docs/settings.example.jsonc): every option
that exists today, with its default value and what it does. Copy the blocks
you want and strip the comments (the real file is strict JSON). In short:

- `shell` — program + args launched for each session (default: the platform
  login shell).
- `theme` — `"dark"` (default) or `"light"` GUI chrome; the terminal grid
  keeps its own colours.
- `close` — per-action close confirmation (`tab`, `app`): always, only while
  a foreground process runs (default), or never.
- `terminal` — base `font_size` (the zoom shortcuts step from it), grid
  `colors` (a named scheme — Solarized / Gruvbox, dark or light — plus
  per-slot overrides), and the two clipboard mouse gestures
  (`copy_on_select`, `paste_on_right_click`), both off by default.
- `sidebar` — sessions listed per project before the tail folds behind an
  expander (`0` shows all).
- `record` — the GIF screencast budget (fps, duration cap, frame scale).
- `open` — the editor command a Ctrl/Cmd-clicked file path opens in, with
  `{path}` / `{line}` / `{col}` templates (default: the OS default handler,
  which cannot honour a line number).
- `keys` — keyboard overrides, one chord or a list per action; the full
  action vocabulary and its default chords are listed in the template.

Some of these are also readable and writable from inside a Claude session via
the MCP control surface (below) — the catalogue there is narrower than this
list, and widening it is tracked separately.

Window size and position persist separately to `~/.termherd/window.json` (a
position left off every connected monitor — e.g. on a screen since unplugged —
is dropped so the window re-centers instead of opening out of reach), and
session stars / archives / custom titles — and the repositories you added by
hand — to `~/.termherd/metadata.json` (an overlay — TermHerd never writes under
`~/.claude`). Star (★), archive (⊟) and rename (✎) are buttons on each sidebar
row; a hand-added repository also carries a ✕ that takes it back out.

## Shortcuts

All shortcuts are configurable via the `keys` section of the config file
(above); the table lists the defaults. With a terminal focused:

| Action             | Windows / Linux            | macOS         |
| ------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------- |
| Copy selection     | `Ctrl+Shift+C`             | `Cmd+C`       |
| Paste              | `Ctrl+V` / `Ctrl+Shift+V`  | `Cmd+V`       |
| Next / prev tab    | `Ctrl+Tab` / `Ctrl+Shift+Tab` | (same)     |
| Jump to tab 1–9    | `Ctrl+1` … `Ctrl+9`        | `Cmd+1` … `Cmd+9` |
| Scroll top/bottom  | `Ctrl+Up` / `Ctrl+Down`    | `Cmd+Up` / `Cmd+Down` |
| New shell here     | `Ctrl+T`                   | `Cmd+T`       |
| New Claude here    | `Ctrl+Alt+T`               | `Cmd+Alt+T`   |
| Reopen closed tab  | `Ctrl+Shift+T`             | `Cmd+Shift+T` |
| Close tab / pane   | `Ctrl+W`                   | `Cmd+W`       |
| Split vert. / horiz. | `Ctrl+D` / `Ctrl+Shift+D` | `Cmd+D` / `Cmd+Shift+D` |
| Focus pane         | `Ctrl+Shift+←↑↓→`          | `Cmd+Shift+←↑↓→` |
| Zoom in / out / reset | `Ctrl` + `+` / `-` / `0` | `Cmd` + `+` / `-` / `0` |
| Focus search       | `Ctrl+F`                   | `Cmd+F`       |
| Capture state dump | `Ctrl+Shift+S`             | `Cmd+Shift+S` |
| Record GIF (start/stop) | `Ctrl+Shift+R`        | `Cmd+Shift+R` |
| Interrupt (SIGINT) | `Ctrl+C`                   | `Ctrl+C`      |

Jump-to-tab (`Ctrl`/`Cmd`+`1`–`9`) is matched by physical key position, so it
lands on the same number-row keys on every layout — including AZERTY and QWERTZ,
where those keys produce `&`, `é`, … without Shift.

Dragging with the mouse selects, and the wheel scrolls back through history.
The two classic terminal clipboard gestures are off until you ask for them:
`terminal.copy_on_select` makes a drag release (or a double-click) copy
outright, and `terminal.paste_on_right_click` makes a right-click paste into
the pane under the pointer. Left off, the copy chord reads whatever is
highlighted on screen. In the sidebar, click a project or session to
open it; a tab's `×` also closes it. Hovering a tab shows the session's fuller
description (the same card the sidebar shows). **+ Add a repo** puts a
repository in the sidebar before it has any session — or drop its folder on the
window, which does the same thing (a dropped *file* is ignored).

Holding `Ctrl` — or `Cmd`/`Super`, either one, on every platform — underlines
the URL or **file path** under the pointer, and clicking it opens it. A path
is underlined only once the filesystem confirms it exists — resolved against
the session's live directory,
then the repository holding it, then the launch directory, because `cargo`,
`git` and `pytest` each print relative to a different root. A `:42` suffix is
carried along, but the OS default handler cannot honour it: configure
`open.command` (above) for a file to open *at its line*. Without that command a
path the OS would **run** rather than show — `.app`, `.exe`, `.desktop` — is
neither underlined nor opened, since opening by association means executing;
an explicit editor command consults no association, so it lifts that refusal.

## MCP control surface (experimental)

termherd exposes itself to the Claude sessions it hosts over
[MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io), so a session can read and drive the
workspace it is running in (`F-mcp-control-surface`, [#90]). There are **two
surfaces**, and which one you get depends on how the session was started.

### The live bridge (automatic)

A Claude session **launched from termherd** is wired to an in-process server on
loopback, with a per-session token, injected into its `mcpServers` at spawn —
nothing to configure. It exposes the running workspace:

| Tool | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `list_sessions` | every live session with its stable `handle` |
| `snapshot` | the whole state — config, sidebar, tabs and panes; filterable, no terminal text by default |
| `open_session` · `split_pane` · `focus_pane` · `rename_tab` · `close_pane` | workspace actions, each reporting the resulting focus |
| `run_in_session` | type into a terminal (returns immediately) |
| `wait_for_status` | block until a session goes idle / wants attention |
| `read_terminal` | one pane's visible text |
| `screenshot` | the window as a PNG — for what only pixels show |
| `press_keys` · `run_action` | drive termherd's own interface — chords through the live keymap, or actions by name |
| `add_repo` · `forget_repo` | put a repository in the sidebar before it has any session, and drop that addition |

The loop that makes it useful is **act → wait → observe**: `run_in_session`,
then `wait_for_status`, then `read_terminal`. Sessions are addressed by a
stable `handle` that survives a Claude-side session re-key.

`press_keys` and `run_action` reach the app itself, not a terminal — typing
into a session stays `run_in_session`'s job. A chord goes in as a synthesised
key event down the real keyboard path, so an open prompt consumes it exactly as
it would for a human. Each press reports what happened (`ran`, `inert`,
`overlay`, `typed`, `unbound`), so "nothing visible changed" is never confused
with "it worked".

`escape` leaves **every** prompt, which is what keeps an agent from parking the
app on one it cannot answer; a sidebar rename used to be the exception
([#237]). `enter` confirms the confirmation prompts, but commits neither
rename — those go through a widget callback no synthesised event reaches
([#246]).

Four follow-ups remain: a composed prompt→wait→read in one round trip
([#196]), `enter` on the renames ([#246]), a doc editor that discards unsaved
edits when it closes ([#248]), and reaching the bridge from outside a session
termherd spawned — the launcher cannot drive it today ([#267]).

### The stdio server (manual)

`termherd-mcp` is a separate small binary that exposes termherd's own
**configuration** — so you can ask "what can I configure here?", or "switch me
to a light theme", from any Claude session. Two tools, `list_options` (read)
and `set_option` (write), plus the option **schema** as a resource, all
reflecting `~/.termherd/settings.json`.

It speaks JSON-RPC over stdio. Register it with Claude Code by adding it to your
`mcpServers` config (point `command` at the built binary):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "termherd": { "command": "/path/to/termherd-mcp" }
  }
}
```

Build the binary with `cargo build -p termherd-mcp` (it lands in `target/`).

## Test

```bash
cargo test --workspace
```

## CI gates (mirror locally before pushing)

```bash
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace
cargo deny check         # if cargo-deny installed
```

## Toolchain

Pinned to **rust 1.95.0** via `rust-toolchain.toml`. Edition 2024.

## Layout

```text
crates/core    — domain, headless App, workspace (pane tree), keymap, ports
crates/claude  — Claude CLI format codec (path encode/derive, JSONL)  [pure]
crates/app     — iced GUI shell (M3+); currently a tracing+single-instance stub
```

The hexagonal dependency rule: `app` → `core` ← `adapters` (and `core` →
`claude`). `core` depends on nothing concrete.
