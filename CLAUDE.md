# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this is

`agentmux` (working name) is a Rust replatform of an Electron Claude Code session
manager. The product is a **terminal workspace for Claude Code sessions** —
browse, launch, arrange (tabs + splits), monitor, search — driven from the
keyboard, on macOS Apple Silicon. The restart exists to fix four quality gaps
(god-object, races, silent catches, untestable design) **by construction**.

Authoritative design lives in `docs/PRD.md` and `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`. Read
them before any non-trivial work — the constraints below are downstream of
them.

## Commands

```bash
cargo run -p agentmux-app          # run the binary (M0: tracing + single-instance stub)
cargo test --workspace             # all tests
cargo test -p agentmux-core        # tests for one crate
cargo test -p agentmux-core workspace::tests::split_wraps_leaf  # one test by path

# CI gates — mirror locally before pushing (CI runs all of these and they are blocking)
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace             # CI uses `cargo nextest run --workspace`
cargo deny check                   # if cargo-deny installed

# Markdown is also gated in CI
markdownlint-cli2                  # uses .markdownlint-cli2.jsonc
```

Toolchain is pinned to **Rust 1.95.0 / edition 2024** via `rust-toolchain.toml`
(Q10) — do not bump without updating the pin.

## Architecture — the dependency rule

Hexagonal workspace. The single most important invariant:

```text
app  ──►  core  ◄──  adapters          (adapters depend on core, never reverse)
           │
           ▼
         claude   (pure codec; no I/O)
```

- `crates/core` — domain, headless `App` state machine, `Workspace` (pane tree
  + tabs), keymap, port traits. **Depends only on `claude`.** No I/O, no
  globals, no `unwrap`/`expect`/`panic` (these are clippy-denied here, see
  `crates/core/Cargo.toml`).
- `crates/claude` — pure Claude CLI format codec (path encode/derive, JSONL
  digest, OSC decode). Same strict lint profile as `core`.
- `crates/app` — iced GUI shell. Currently a tracing + single-instance stub;
  M1+ will construct adapters in `main()` and inject them into `core::App`.
- Adapters (`store`, `pty`, `scan`, optional `mcp`) do not yet exist — they
  land per the milestone plan in `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` §15.

When adding code, ask: *which crate does this belong in?* If the answer is
"`core` should call this adapter directly," the answer is wrong — add a port
trait in `core::ports` and have the adapter implement it.

## The headless core (where logic lives)

`core::App::apply(Event) -> Vec<Effect>` is the Elm-style heart of the system
(`crates/core/src/app.rs`). It is **pure**: no I/O, no clock, no panic. The
GUI translates user actions into `Event`s and performs the returned
`Effect`s. Everything testable lives behind `apply`.

`Workspace` (`crates/core/src/workspace.rs`) is the tab/split pane tree — pure
data, exhaustively unit-testable. The focus path is a `Vec<Branch>` from the
root; mutators (`open`, `split`, …) return `Option<()>` rather than panicking
when invariants are violated. Follow that pattern: surface broken invariants
as `None`/`Err`, never `unwrap`.

## Concurrency model (when adapters arrive)

One tokio runtime, **actor-per-session**: each session is owned by a task
holding its PTY handle and terminal grid. Other parts of the system talk to
it only via channels. There is no shared `&mut Session`. The GUI thread owns
`core::App` and applies events single-threaded. This is the structural fix for
the `realSessionId` race (Q6 in `docs/PRD.md` §4) — keep it.

## Quality bar — non-negotiable

Each rule below is tied to a Q-row in `docs/PRD.md` §4 (the reason the rewrite
exists). Do not relax them locally.

- **`core` and `claude`**: clippy denies `unwrap_used`, `expect_used`, `panic`.
  Tests may use them (`clippy.toml` allows it in tests). Production paths
  return typed errors (`thiserror`).
- **No global mutable state.** No `static mut`, no `lazy_static`, no
  require-time singletons. Construct dependencies in `main()` and inject.
- **One logging stack:** `tracing`. No `println!` outside tests.
- **`unsafe_code = "deny"`** workspace-wide.

## Conventions

- Markdown prose: 80-col wrap (tables / code blocks exempt, see
  `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`).
- Commit messages: no "Claude" signature (per global user instruction).
- Status of every feature is tracked in `ROADMAP.md` (MoSCoW from PRD §5).
  Check the ticked/unticked state there before assuming something is built.
